  <h1>Three Methods of Adding CSS</h1>
  <!-- Create 3 Links to The 3 Webpages: inline, internal and external -->
  <a href="./inline.html">Inline CSS</a>
  <a href="./internal.html">Internal CSS</a>
  <a href="./external.html">External CSS</a>

<!--
  Inline CSS:
  CSS is coded within HTML itself. It's coded for a specific element.
  ex: <html style="background: blue"></html>

  It's good to use when you need to use a singular element on the HTML page.

  Internal CSS:
  CSS is coded within HTML again. Here, CSS would be applied to everything on the webpage.
  ex: 
  <html>
  <head>
    <style>
      html {background: red}
    </style>
  </head>
</html>

It's good to use when CSS is being applied to only one HTML document/webpage.

External CSS:
Here, the CSS file will be written separately from HTML.
On HTML, write:
<html>
  <head>
    <link 
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="./styles.css"
    />
  </head>
</html>

On CSS, write:
html{
  background:green;
}

It's industry standard as it applies CSS to multiple webpages.
